+ Orleans -> Virtual Entities
+ Orelans is an actor-based programming model and runtime.
+ In comparison with traditional actor-based systems, Orleans treats actors as virtual entities, not physical ones.
+ Actors are the basic building blocks of Orleans: basic units of isolation and distribution.
+ Bad:
  + Orleans is not intended for multi-tenant environments
+ Good:
  + We could leverage the idea of "virtual entities" as a "never ending resource of execution actors"
