+ Ambrosia -> Virtual Resilience
+ Ambrosia is a distributed programing framework that aims to handle:
  - Non-determinism
  - Machine heterogeneity
  - Resilience level heterogeneity
  - Language agnostic
+ It is a peer-to-peer system
+ It  builds on the concept of virtual resiliency
  - A distributed platform capability which enables failure-oblivious code to run unaltered of eventual failures.
+ It very much bases on concepts from databases research (for resilience and such).
+ Good:
  - Virtual Resilience thing could be leveraged using our existing stateful approach (performant enough?)
+ Bad:
  - Elasticity
